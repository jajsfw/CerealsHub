When you encounter the following error message:
```
No assistant available.
```

This issue arises when a new, unintentional file appears in `/jan/assistants`.

It can be resolved through the following steps:

1. Access the `/jan/assistants` directory using a file manager or terminal.

2. Within `/jan/assistants`, this directory should only contain a folder named `jan`. Identify any file outside of this folder and remove it.
