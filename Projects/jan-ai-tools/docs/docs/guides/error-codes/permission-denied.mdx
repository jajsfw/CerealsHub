When running Jan, you might encounter the following error message:

```
Uncaught (in promise) Error: Error invoking layout-480796bff433a3a3.js:538 remote method 'installExtension':
Error Package /Applications/Jan.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar.unpacked/pre-install/janhq-assistant-extension-1.0.0.tgz does not contain a valid manifest:
Error EACCES: permission denied, mkdtemp '/Users/username/.npm/_cacache/tmp/ueCMn4'
```

This error mainly caused by permission problem during installation. To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Execute the following command to change ownership of the `~/.npm` directory to the current user:

```sh
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm
```
:::note
This command ensures that the necessary permissions are granted for Jan installation, resolving the encountered error.
