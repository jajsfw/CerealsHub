Encountering an `undefined issue` in Jan is caused by errors related to the Nitro tool or other internal processes. It can be resolved through the following steps:

1. Clearing the Jan folder and then reopen the application to determine if the problem persists
2. Manually run the nitro tool located at `~/jan/extensions/@janhq/inference-nitro-extensions/dist/bin/(your-os)/nitro` to check for error messages.
3. Address any nitro error messages that are identified and reassess the persistence of the issue.
4. Reopen Jan to determine if the problem has been resolved after addressing any identified errors.
5. If the issue persists, please share the [app logs](https://jan.ai/troubleshooting/how-to-get-error-logs/) via [Jan Discord](https://discord.gg/mY69SZaMaC) for further assistance and troubleshooting.
