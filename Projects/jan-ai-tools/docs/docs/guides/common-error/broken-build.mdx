        ### 1. Uninstall Jan

        Delete Jan from your `/Applications` folder.

        ### 2. Delete Application Data, Cache, and User Data

        ```zsh
        # Step 1: Delete the application data
        ## Newer versions
        rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/jan
        ## Versions 0.2.0 and older
        rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/jan-electron

        # Step 2: Clear application cache
        rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/jan*

        # Step 3: Remove all user data
        rm -rf ~/jan
        ```

        ### 3. Additional Step for Versions Before 0.4.2

        If you are using a version before `0.4.2`, you need to run the following commands:

        ps aux | grep nitro
        # Looks for processes like `nitro` and `nitro_arm_64`, and kill them one by one by process ID
        kill -9 <PID>
        ```
